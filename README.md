# üìä Predictive Analytics for Revenue Forecasting and Sales Optimization

This project focuses on applying advanced predictive analytics techniques to forecast revenue and optimize sales performance using time series data. Leveraging various statistical and machine learning models, the objective is to provide actionable insights for proactive decision-making in business contexts.

---

## üöÄ Project Goals

- Forecast future revenue based on historical sales data.
- Identify seasonal trends and anomalies.
- Optimize sales strategies through predictive modeling.
- Compare and evaluate different forecasting models for accuracy and performance.

---

## üß† Models Used

The following models were implemented and evaluated for forecasting:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**
- **Prophet (by Meta)**

Each model was tested using appropriate evaluation metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE to determine forecasting accuracy.
